# Object Detection in an Urban Environment

## Project overview
The goal of this project is to create a Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) that can detect objects in an urban environment. Specifically, we are looking to detect pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles. This involves being able to detect the bounding boxes of each object in a frame, and also to classify those identified objects.

Object Detection is critical to self-driving cars because it is needed for both safety and navigational needs. It's important to be able to identify both what and where something is on a particular image. For all objects, it's essential to ensure the car does not run into anything and maintains a safe distance. Without object detection (which uses camera images), the car would essentially be blind to the world.

## Set up
[This section should contain a brief description of the steps to follow to run the code for this repository.]

## Dataset
### Dataset analysis
The data in this set come in the form of 640x640 images. Each image looks like the following image:

![Unaltered Image](img/base.png?raw=true)







This section should contain a quantitative and qualitative description of the dataset. It should include images, charts and other visualizations.

### Cross validation
This section should detail the cross validation strategy and justify your approach.

## Training
### Reference experiment
This section should detail the results of the reference experiment. It should includes training metrics and a detailed explanation of the algorithm's performances.

### Improve on the reference
This section should highlight the different strategies you adopted to improve your model. It should contain relevant figures and details of your findings.
